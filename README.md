## Installation

Soda theme is designed to work with the latest development builds of Sublime Text, including [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/dev) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3dev).

### Using Sublime Package Control

If you are using Will Bond's excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can easily install Soda Theme via the `Package Control: Install Package` menu item. The Soda Theme package is listed as `Theme - Soda` in the packages list.

### Using Git

Alternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text application settings area.

You can locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/ "Theme - Soda"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - Soda`
* Find your `Packages` directory using the menu item  `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`
* Copy the folder into your Sublime Text `Packages` directory

## Activating the theme

To configure Sublime Text to use the theme, follow the instructions below for your specific version.

### Sublime Text 2

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"` or `"theme": "Soda Dark.sublime-theme"`

**Example Sublime Text 2 User Settings**

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"
    }

### Sublime Text 3

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Light 3.sublime-theme"` or `"theme": "Soda Dark 3.sublime-theme"`

**Example Sublime Text 3 User Settings**

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light 3.sublime-theme"
    }

## Additional Features

### Alternate Tab Styles

Soda Theme ships with two alternate UI tab styles.

By default, a square tab style is used. If you'd prefer to use the original curved tab style, add the following custom setting to your `Settings - User` file:

    "soda_classic_tabs": true
